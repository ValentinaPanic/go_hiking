# GoHiking

Welcome to the GoHiking Gem! This gem was developed as a Flatiron School project. I developed this gem to help users explore Colorado hiking trails  through a command line interface. This gem allows the user to view a list of trails 25 miles from Denver and shows details about each one of them once the user chooses desired trail.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'go_hiking'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install go_hiking

## Usage

Execute the bin file './bin/run'. You will be prompted with a list of the trails. Once you chose a number of desired trail, full-detailed description will be shown to you.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
